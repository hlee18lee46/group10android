Project Ideas:

# Daniel's Ideas:
1. Fitness app
    - Allows users to track calories, workouts (reps/sets), weight, etc.
    - Creates a graph to track progress over time
    - Allows you to create a workout plan/schedule and sends notifications
2. Habit Tracker app
    - Lets you track any sort of habit. Exercise, sleep, studying, etc.
    - Gamifies it by giving you rewards for progress to encourage habit building
    - Sends motivational notifications and reminders
3. Email Helper app
    - Uses OpenAI ChatGPT API to give you notifications for important emails, summarizing them into a few sentences.
    - Allows you to generate a simple response with ChatGPT (Of course letting you check accuracy before sending)
    - Sends notifications to remind you to respond to certain important emails or follow up when you haven't gotten a response
4. AI Study Helper
    - Uses ChatGPT API (not sure how it would get access to lecture videos yet)
    - Summarizes lecture videos into bulleted notes for you to study
    - Builds you a study plan and finds YouTube videos for topics you may need help with
5. Assignment Assistant App
    - Accesses assignments using the Canvas API
    - Gives points and rewards for scoring high on assignments, turning in on time, etc.
    - Gives push notifications for when assignments are upcoming (would actually be pretty useful since canvas doesn't do this)
    - A better calendar/dashboard than the mobile Canvas app
    

# Kevin Ideas - List:

    *    Notify the user if they are off their pomodoro, and prvides a duolingo style rewards system for consistent use
    *    Allwos use to build your own system of the type of thing you are using your pomodoro for, for better tracking, and for better comparison before users
