## Overview

### Description

1. Assignment Assistant App
    - Accesses assignments using the Canvas API
    - Gives points and rewards for scoring high on assignments, turning in on time, etc.
    - Gives push notifications for when assignments are upcoming (would actually be pretty useful since canvas doesn't do this)
    - A better calendar/dashboard than the mobile Canvas app
    - Provides a better to do list than canvas, potentially with a user based ranking system based on assignment importance and time required 
    

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Productivity/Education
- **Mobile:** Can exist as a web application but as a mobile app, it uses notifications to alert the user of incoming assignments, as well as it points and rewards system make it more suitable for a mobile app.
- **Story:** provieds a better more efficient form of assignment tracking then the current canvas app, students when using the app will see an improvement in their ability to keep up with and know about assignments.
- **Market:** Any student who uses canvas will see a use for this app
- **Habit:** The rewards/points system forms a good productive habit, promoting punctuality in its user, through consistent use
- **Scope:** The app within the allotted time, can be assumed to be in some working order. Its objectives are things we have worked on through these past 6 weeks, the difficutlty may however come from its UI.
